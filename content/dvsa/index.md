## Overview

This is undoubtedly one of the most complex services I've ever had to work on. The DVSA is responsible for safety on Britain's roads and tests hundreds of thousands of vehicles every year to ensure that vehicles meet safety standards. Not only were the existing processes complex and inefficient, the existing packages were slow and complex, and a previous supplier had failed to deliver the project, meaning we had to learn a lot and pull on a lot of existing loose threads. The service users include commercial customers – haulage operators and bus companies – vehicle owners and importers, and staff members within the DVSA across multiple departments.

## Project objectives

* Provide a service compliant with the GOV.UK Service Standard to Authorised Testing Facilities (ATFs) to monitor DVSA testing activity at their sites. This service is on a GOV.UK domain and is called "Manage your vehicle testing"
* Modernise decades of legacy processes and bring IT to a cloud-hosted solution. This includes vehicle technical and test data records, applications made by vehicle owners and operators, financial transactions, and contractual information.

## Creation of the "Manage your vehicle testing" service

* ATFs are garages – often operated by bus operators or haulage companies – that enter a contract with the DVSA to provide facilities to perform tests on vehicles. They pay the DVSA for each test from an pre-funded account (PFA) that they setup with the DVSA when they become an ATF.
* Monitoring their PFA balance and topping up their account, seeing when tests are completed and what they will be charged, and searching through past transactions are all common activities that ATFs need to perform in order to successfully run their businesses. Prior to the CVS project, they have been heavily reliant on making direct contact with the DVSA in order to perform all of these, which is frustrating and inefficient for both parties.
* The service we designed provides ATFs with the ability to: view their balance and running total of tests completed today, a full breakdown of transactions, a view of today's completed tests, the ability to top-up their account, and a team member management area to add/remove other staff members within their organisation.
* The longer term aims of the service would also incorporate a previously identified user need to "Apply for a vehicle test, approval, or replacement certificate". These applications are often made by ATFs themselves, as well as vehicle importers and manufacturers, many of whom also hold pre-funded accounts with the DVSA to pay for these tests.

## Examples

### CVS – service overview and blueprint

* During the first phase of the project – "milestone 0" – we picked up any existing research and work that was done by the previous supplier, as well as the broad aims and scope provided by the DVSA's service and product owners.
* One of the user-centred design team's first tasks was to create a draft service blueprint, that showed the end-to-end processes of testing vehicles end-to-end (from manufacture through testing) and front-to-back (from the owner/operator/manufacturer of the vehicle, through the various staff members at ATFs and within the DVSA, all the way to the systems that would support each aspect of the service)
* Each process her was documented in more detail separately e.g. the standards requirements for each vehicle and how applicants would go about certifying those requirements.
* This was a key aspect of the project as the GOV.UK service manual stresses the importance of understanding not only th needs of your users, but the context of your service in the broader picture e.g. a vehicle manufacturer will have already been in contact with other government agencies such as the DVLA, VCA, and HMRC (acronyms are all over the civil service!)

### Manage your vehicle testing – design iteration and development of GOV.UK service

* The previous phase of the project had helped to identify our users and their needs, resulting in the design of portal that ATFs could use to manage testing on their sites
* As a user-centred design team, we felt there were aspects of the existing design work that didn't marry up with the findings of the research, and gaps in the documented decision making
