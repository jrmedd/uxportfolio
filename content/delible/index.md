## Overview

My therapist recently asked me to start writing things down. The purpose of this writing isn't to record anything, just to get it out of my brain. Doing this repeatedly helps me to get things straight, and form positive mental pathways for things that I don't do habitually. I don't like to waste paper, so I created Delible ink.

Unlike indelible ink, this ink won't last longer than a day. Anything you type into it is totally private and disappears completely at midnight. It's minimal and unobtrusive, so I can focus on getting my thoughts down without too much distraction.

If this sounds like something that might help you, you can find it at [delible.ink](https://delible.ink/), or download it on [Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9mxbbnkn1t9x?hl=en-gb&gl=US) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ink.delible.twa).

## How it works

Delible ink is completely private by design and doesn't share any data with the rest of the web. The application runs in the browser alone and doesn't send any data back to a server. Text is kept until midnight in localStorage, which means it is stored by the browser. There is a basic form of encryption to ensure the stored text is garbled until Delible Ink. is opened by the user.
