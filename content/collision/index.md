## Overview

This piece of work was a commission from Manchester-based arts and technology organisation [FutureEverything](https://futureeverthing.org). As part of their [this place \[of mine\]](https://thisplaceofmine.org) project, I took part in workshops with young people across Greater Manchester to imagine their future high streets. In response to these workshops, I created this online creative experience.

## When worlds collide

During my conversations with them, I learned that young people had no sense of ownership of their high streets, which they felt were lacking colour and creative opportunities. In discussions about online worlds such as Roblox – which they frequently inhabited – I learned that online spaces offer freedom of creativity and play. In the words of one of the young people, they would like to see a "collision" of physical and online worlds.

## Creating an online art creation tool

During the workshops. the young people were invited to create abstract digital artworks using a variety of online tools. Seeing how positively they responded to these activities, I wa inspired to create a short online creative experience of my own for them to experiment with.

"Planting a flag" is a centuries-old practice used to claim ownership of places. They also act as markers of human endeavour, with the act of planting a flag being just as symbolically important as the colours borne by them. The resulting experience that I created invited the people of Greater Manchester to design and plant their own flags in places that have personal significance to them.

I created a virtual twin of the region in Roblox, which was mapped to the GPS coordinates from Leigh to Stalybridge. The flag designer was a simple pixel art tool accessed via a web browser. Once participants were happy with their flags, they could go out into the world and plant them using their phones. These would then appear in the Roblox flag space, where participants were invited to visit and explore, effectively turning the entire city into a DIY art gallery.
